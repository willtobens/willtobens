### Hello! My name is Will and I'm a software developer passionate about computers, music, and environmental efforts.

- I recently finished my senior project, [GE's Dictionary of People and Places](https://github.com/GeorgeEliotArchive/Dictionary-of-GE-s-People-and-Places). You can view it on the George Eliot Archive website [here](https://georgeeliotarchive.org/dictionary).
- In the near future, I want to create a Proof of Concept music playlist creator based on roadtrip plans
